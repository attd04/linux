------ TASK 1 ------
#First script:
# 1. Create a directory
mkdir d1

# Set the environment variable with the directory name
2. export MY_DIRECTORY="d1"

#3. In terminal window show the directory name and run the second script
echo "$MY_DIRECTORY" && touch "$MY_DIRECTORY/file1.txt" "$MY_DIRECTORY/file2.txt" "$MY_DIRECTORY/file3.txt"
echo "Directory name: $MY_DIRECTORY"

# Run the second script
./second_script.sh

#Second script:
# 1. List directory and files in it
ls "$MY_DIRECTORY"

# 2. Create a few files in the directory using the environment variable
touch "$MY_DIRECTORY/file1.txt"
touch "$MY_DIRECTORY/file2.txt"
touch "$MY_DIRECTORY/file3.txt"

# 3. List directory and files in it again
ls "$MY_DIRECTORY"


------ TASK 2 ------
# First script:
# Create 5 files with different names, one containing "b" in the name
touch file1.txt file2.txt file_b.txt file3.txt file4.txt

# Store the filename with "b" symbol in an environment variable using filename substitution
FILE_B=$(ls | grep 'b.*\.txt')
export FILE_B

# Show the full list of files in alphabetical order
ls | sort

# Run second script
./second_script.sh

# Second script:
# Delete the file stored in the environment variable
rm "$FILE_B"

# Show the full list of files in alphabetical order
ls | sort

------ THEORY ------
1. Why scalar variables are also called name-value pair?
Because the value of a scalar variable can be assigned by writing 'NAME=VALUE'

2. What syntax allows to list all elements in an array?
@ or *

3. What does wildcard symbol ? allows to change in the file name?
matching a single character in a filename. example: 
file1.txt
file2.txt
fileA.txt
fileB.txt
using "?", you can match files with a similar pattern where the "?" represents a single character:
 file?.txt will match file1.txt and file2.txt but not fileA.txt or fileB.txt

4. What is called local variable in shell programming?
Local
