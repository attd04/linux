--------- task 2

First script:
Create directory
In directory create 1200 files with different names. The format of the file name: XXX.txt, where X are letters from a to z.
Read the letter entered by the user
Store in environment variable only files with the user specified letter in their name.
Run a second script

COUNTER = 0

for x in {a..z}; do
    for y in {a..z}; do
        for z in {a..z}; do
            let COUNTER++
            if [ $COUNTER -le 1200 ]; then
                touch "d1/$x$y$z.txt"
            fi
        done
    done
done
        
# Read the letter entered by the user
read -p "Enter a letter: " letter

# Store in environment variable only files with the user specified letter in their name.
files_with_letter=$(find d1 -type f -name "*$letter*")

./second_script.sh

Second script:
Display the contents of the directory and the number of files in them
Delete only files, which names are in the environment variable
Display the contents of the directory and the number of files in them
mkdir d1




theory: 
1. What $@ special variable is used for?
all of the parameters passed to the script

2. What basename command is used for?
strips directory information and suffixes from file names 

3. What is the difference between echo and printf commands?
printf has more precise control over what's being printed so it's more suitable for numbers and decimals.
echo is good for printing text or strings because it has very little formatting requirements

4. Why do we need > symbol in the output?
